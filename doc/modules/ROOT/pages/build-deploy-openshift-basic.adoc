= Build and Deploy Your Java Application With WildFly on OpenShift

This tutorial will illustrate how to build and deploy a Java application with WildFly on OpenShift.

This is based on the https://github.com/wildfly-up-and-running/wuar-demo[wuar-demo] that contains a Jakarta Web deployment.
The https://github.com/wildfly-up-and-running/wuar-demo[README] of the project lists how to create the application image that contains WildFly and the Web deployment and deploy it on Kubernetes.

In this tutorial, we will explain the different configuration to achieve this result.
