= Build and Deploy Your Java Application With WildFly on OpenShift

This tutorial will illustrate how to build and deploy a Java application with WildFly on OpenShift.

== Prerequisites

* Access to an OpenShift cluster (e.g. https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox/)

== Application Overview

For this tutorial, we will use the `microprofile-config` quickstart for WildFly.
This is a simple Java application which provides JAX-RS endpoints and reads configuration using MicroProfile Config.

The code is located at https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart/tree/master/microprofile-config.

== Add a Helm Chart for WildFly

We will build and deploy the application on OpenShift using the Helm Chart for WildFly that is provided by the OpenShift Developer Console.

* Go to the OpenShift Dev Console (in the `Topology` perspective)
* Click on `+ Add > Helm Chart > WildFly``
* Click on `Install Helm Chart`
  We need to configure the Helm Chart to build and deploy our quickstart.

  1. First, we will change the name of the release to `my-wildfly-app` in the `Release Name` field instead of the default `wildfly`.
  2. We will change the YAML content to configure the Helm Chart by copying the following content in the YAML view:

[source,yaml]
----
build:
  uri: https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git
  ref: 24.0.0.SP1
  mode: bootable-jar
  env:
  - name: ARTIFACT_DIR
    value: microprofile-config/target
  - name: MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND
    value: -am -pl microprofile-config -Pbootable-jar-openshift -Djkube.skip=true
  - name: MAVEN_OPTS
    value: '-XX:MetaspaceSize=251m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256m'
deploy:
  replicas: 1
  env:
  - name: CONFIG_PROP
    value: Hello from OpenShift
----

* Click on `Install`

The Helm release will build and deploy the Java applications.
It will display information to interact with the deployed resources from the command-line interface using `oc`:

[source,shell]
----
Your WildFly appplication is building! To follow the build, run:

$ oc get build -w

Note that your Deployment will report "ErrImagePull" and "ImagePullBackOff" until the build is complete. Once the build is complete, your image will be automatically rolled out.

To follow the deployment of your application, run:

$ oc get deployment my-wildfly-app -w
----

From the OpenShift Developer Console, we can use the `Topology` view to see progress on the build and deployment of our application:

[#img-helm-release-toplogy-openshift] 
.Helm Release of the application displayed in OpenShift Topology view 
image::helm-release-toplogy-openshift.png[Helm Release of the application displayed in OpenShift Topology view ]

When build is finished (the bottom-left icon will display a green check) and the application is deployed (the circle outline is in dark blue), you can go the the URL (using the top-right icon) from the `Route`, append `/config/value` and you will see the message:

----
Hello from OpenShift
----

This message corresponds to the `CONFIG_PROP` environment variable defined in the Helm Chart YAML file.

Congratulations, you have built and deployed your first Java application with WildFly on OpenShift!
